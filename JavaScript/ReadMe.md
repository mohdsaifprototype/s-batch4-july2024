# JavaScript
JavaScript is a prototype based scripting language.
- It was developed using C language by Brendan Eich in 1995.
- It is used by most of the modern browsers.
- It is also used by Node.js.
- In starting it was consisdered as front-end scrippting language but, now we can also use it for server side scripting with the help of Node.js

It's second name was LiveScript then it was renamed to JavaScript to gain popularity as the younger brother of Java. However, later on it became a fully independent language and now there is no relation between Java and JavaScript.
